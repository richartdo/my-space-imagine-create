# 🏗️ [Design Me](https://my-space-imagine-create.vercel.app/)

**Design Me** is a full-stack interior design platform that helps users visualize and plan the design of various spaces — including homes, hospitals, classrooms, shops, garages, student bedsitters, compounds, offices, events (tent arrangements), and many more.

---

## 🧩 What is Design Me?

Design Me is an interactive web application where users can:

- Select a design category (e.g., kitchen, classroom, event)
- Upload a photo or blueprint of the space
- Use design tools to drag, drop, replace, and color items
- Store and revisit past designs
- Apply design proposals from other users or AI suggestions

This system enables anyone — from students in small university rooms to professional decorators — to easily prototype interior layouts before committing resources.

## 🚀 How It Helps

- 🧱 Helps users pre-plan space arrangement
- 🛠️ Enables furniture/tool customization
- 🎨 Allows color editing and item replacement
- 💡 Offers design proposals and inspiration
- 🗂️ Saves work in the cloud for future editing
- 👥 Supports multi-type spaces — from bedsitters to city planning
